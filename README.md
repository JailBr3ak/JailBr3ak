## About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional in training with a strong foundation in **Active Directory attack and defense**, **web enumeration**, and core **penetration testing** practices. I enjoy building secure systems and diving deep into **SIEM/IDS technologies** like the **ELK Stack**, **Wazuh**, and **Snort**. My experience includes deploying centralized logging platforms, simulating advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks, and hardening enterprise networks through meticulous configuration and monitoring.

With a background in both back‑end and front‑end development, I’m comfortable working across the stack and constantly look for opportunities to blend software engineering with security research. I love participating in Hack The Box labs and other CTF challenges to sharpen my skills.

## Experience

### ELK Setup and Monitoring – Academic Project (Jul 2025 – Aug 2025)
- Deployed a centralized logging and monitoring platform using the **ELK Stack**.  
- Integrated multiple devices via Beats/Syslog and built **Logstash** pipelines for parsing and normalization.  
- Created **Kibana** dashboards for health and trend analysis, configured alerting and access controls, and managed retention policies.  
- Documented the deployment for repeatability and scalability.

### Enterprise Network Security – Academic Project (Mar 2025 – Apr 2025)
- Simulated **APT attacks** in an Active Directory lab using **BloodHound** and the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework.  
- Performed credential dumping, lateral movement, and privilege escalation before implementing detection with **Snort** and **SIEM tools** (ELK, Wazuh).  
- Hardened Active Directory via **Group Policy** enforcement, misconfiguration remediation, and **pfSense** firewall rules.  
- Documented attack paths, detection strategies, and mitigation techniques.
