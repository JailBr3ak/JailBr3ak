About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional in training with a strong foundation in Active Directory attack and defense, web enumeration, and core penetration testing practices. I enjoy building secure systems and diving deep into SIEM/IDS technologies like the ELK Stack, Wazuh, and Snort. My experience includes deploying centralized logging platforms, simulating advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks, and hardening enterprise networks through meticulous configuration and monitoring.

With a background in both back‑end and front‑end development, I’m comfortable working across the stack and constantly look for opportunities to blend software engineering with security research. I love participating in Hack The Box labs and other CTF challenges to sharpen my skills.

Experience
ELK Setup and Monitoring – Academic Project (Jul 2025 – Aug 2025)

Deployed a centralized logging and monitoring platform using the ELK Stack.

Integrated multiple devices via Beats/Syslog and built Logstash pipelines for parsing and normalization.

Created Kibana dashboards for health and trend analysis, configured alerting and access controls, and managed retention policies.

Documented the deployment for repeatability and scalability.
